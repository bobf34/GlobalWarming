# Global Warming
A simple, but surprisingly accurate model for predicting global temperatures using using sunspots and CO2 concentrations. Volcanic activity and climate oscillations will cause the actual temperature to fluctuate around the prediction.

### To Run
Download both py files
<br>
Run tempPredict.py

### Changing the model
There are several different preconfigured models in a comment block.  Copy the desired model *parms* dictionary and replace (or place below) the parms dictionary located just below the comment block.  You can also create your own model by adjusting the parameters of an existing model.

### Selecting Plots
A variable called *showExtra* can be configured to show the model, or the prediction error.

### Required Datasets
The first time you run the program it will automatically download the two required datasets.
